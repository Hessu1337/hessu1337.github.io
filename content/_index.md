## 👋 About Me

Hey there — I’m **Gonzague**, a **DevOps engineer** currently based in **Switzerland**.  
I’m passionate about **automation, reliability, and continuous improvement** in software systems. Over the past few years, I’ve worked across both **infrastructure** and **software development**, bridging the gap between development teams and operations to build scalable, secure, and efficient environments.

I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing workflows, and helping teams deliver faster and more confidently. My background in development and IT infrastructure gives me a strong technical foundation, while my focus on **collaboration and empathy** helps create a positive and productive work environment.

## 💡 What I Value

- **Resilience and reliability** — in both systems and people.  
- **Knowledge sharing** — helping others grow makes the team stronger.  
- **Balance** — good engineering isn’t just technical; it’s human.  

I’m especially motivated by environments where technology serves a **long-term vision**, not just short-term goals. That’s why I’m drawn to stable, high-quality organizations where craftsmanship and resilience truly matter.

## 🛠️ A Few Things I Work With

- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Helm  
- **CI/CD:** ArgoCD, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Cloud:** GCP, AWS, and on-prem clusters  
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Bash  

## 🐾 Outside of Work

When I’m not tuning clusters or optimizing pipelines, you’ll probably find me outdoors — walking my **White Swiss Shepherd** Utah, exploring nature, or taking time to reflect and recharge.  

I believe good ideas come from balance; between pressure and perspective.

I'm always happy to connect with like-minded engineers, teams, and curious minds.
